# Web Analytics: Visualizing a Website's Events For Analytics
This is a Data Visualization project carried out a web events dataset from the website of the company — TheLook, which is a fictitious e-commerce clothing site developed by the Looker team. It assesses the activities of a hundred thousand customers on the website. This project analyzes this information in order to gain insights to help understand and optimize web performance.

This project reports on:
• Online Traffic: This helps to track the traffic source of the customer, measure the number of events per customer and recurring activities
• Top Cities by Events and Purchases: This shows the best cities to target for marketing campaigns
• Purchases by Browser: This shows the preferred browser for purchases
• Purchases by Year: Here, we see the online purchases from 2019-2024, with a spike in 2023

This project serves to demonstrate a typical role of an organization's Marketing & Product Analyst, which includes the assessing and reporting of users' events on the website to aid in optimizing advertising campaigns, measuring bounce and user conversion rates, and enabling more data-driven decisions by using KPIs to implement strategies to achieve business goals.
